## Stock Analyze 
This project is to analyze market data for each given year.  The script iterates through rows to aggregate trading volume. 
When a new ticker identified, price changes are calculated.

1-Yearly change calculated by subtracting first open price to last close price for each ticker and year (sheet).
*Color coded for positive and negative values 
2-Percentage change was calculated with yearly change divided by first open price.
3-Total stock volume calculated next to each ticker.  

## Summary Table
1-  Greatest % Increase and Decrease are calculated with comparing yearly change percentage values.
 2- Greatest Volume is calculated with stocks yearly totals volumes.  

Note: GitHub didn't allow me to upload my screen shots, they were PNG files. I had to upload them to my google drive
